### What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

Cybersecurity is important because it protects all categories of data from theft and damage. This includes sensitive data, personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI), personal information, intellectual property, data, and government and industry information systems.

Cybersecurity measures are designed to reduce the risk of cyberattacks and mitigate the damage that they can cause. These measures can include:

Technical controls: These are measures that are implemented in computer systems and networks to protect them from attack. Examples of technical controls include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption.
Physical controls: These are measures that are implemented to protect physical assets, such as computers and servers, from attack. Examples of physical controls include security cameras, access control systems, and security guards.
Procedural controls: These are policies and procedures that are designed to protect information and systems from attack. Examples of procedural controls include security awareness training, incident response plans, and data backup and recovery procedures.
Cybersecurity is an ongoing process that requires continuous attention and improvement. As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, cybersecurity measures must also evolve to keep up.
