Make sure you’ve got something to submit for each of the topics listed in the rubric.

### Complete submission

In whatever format the assessment has to be in (Document, Presentation, Code, Video etc), work on covering all the topics required.

Read the information on how to earn the different Grade levels.

As a General Rule they are:

| Grade | Required Standard                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E     | The submission barely covers the base requirements of the topic.                                                                                                                                                   |
| D     | The submission doesn’t cover all of the base requirements of the topic.                                                                                                                                            |
| C     | The submission covers the base requirements of the topic. For example, submits the in-class tasks.                                                                                                                 |
| B     | The submission includes the base requirements and also includes an analysis of the topic. This analysis could include an in-depth explanation of how the topic functions, including correct technical terminology. |
| A     | All of the above, and a critical analysis - evaluating the approach taken, offering other potential solutions, using research, and weighing the pros and cons of each approach.                                    |
