# Javascript - Software Development Fundamentals

This course introduces you to software development with a focus on Arduino as the environment - the language, IDE and platform.

# Course Topics

- Programming Introduction - Web Development
    
    
    # Specific Implementation
    
    As with other areas of Programming, Web Development can have different focuses or paths to choose from. The focus of this course is learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and later on, learning Python.
    
    ## Website Development - A Brief Overview
    
    There are two main areas of website development - Front End and Back End. 
    
    **Front End Development** is what the end-user sees. This is referred to as client-side, meaning the code runs in the browser. Development in this area focuses on the aesthetics of the website - how the website looks and feels.
    
    **Back End Development** is server-side. This area of development focuses on databases and providing data to the front end. The code runs on the server. 
    
    Over the year, this course focuses on both front end and back end development.
    
    Developers who code both front end and back end are referred to as **full stack developers.**

    ## Front End Development - A Brief Overview
    
    **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create the structure and content of the web page. It is used to define what is being shown and where.
    
    **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to tell the browser how to display the content. For instance: The font size, colour spacing, background colour and much more.
    
    **JavaScript** is used to add interactivity and some dynamic content. 
    
    These are the three main categories of code in this phase of the course.

    ## Back End Development - A Brief Overview
    
    Back End development usually focuses on coding secure, controllable access to a database. 
    
    Example programming languages are **Python**, **PHP**. 
    
    Databases are critical in any moderately sized web application to store and provide data to the user. Some example database systems are MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, SQLite.
    
    **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is the standard language to provide access to a database.

    # Practical Exercises
    
    In your Software Development Fundamentals project, create a new HTML5 file called `operations.html`.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-04 at 9.32.32 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-04_at_9.32.32_pm.png)
    
    Replace the contents of this file with:
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <body>
    
    <h1>Mathematical & Logic Operations - Web Development</h1>
    
    <form name='loginForm'>
        <b>Login Page</b>
        <p>
            Username:<input type='text' size=25 name='userid'><br>
            Password:<input type='Password' size=25 name='pwd'><br>
            <input type='submit' onclick='check(this.form)' value='Login'>
        </p>
    </form>
    <script>
        function check(form) {
            if (<!-- Update this condition -->) {
                window.open('README.md')
            } else {
                alert('Error Password or Username')/*displays error message*/
            }
        }
    </script>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    ## Username and Password
    
    This requirements for this page is that the username and password entered in the form are checked and confirmed to be correct before proceeding. If either of the username or password data is incorrect, and error will be displayed to the user. 
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ With the form already configured, the only section that needs to be updated is the `if` statement. `if` statements are covered in a later section, however the condition needs to be added.
    
    </aside>
    
    Both the username and the password need to be correct for the page to load the [README.md](http://README.md) file. If either or both of the two inputs are incorrect, then an error will be displayed. **What logic gate/truth table/logic operator is required?**
    
    The answer is `AND` as both sides of the AND need to be true for the result to be true.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ The operator for `AND` in Javascript is `&&`.
    
    </aside>
    
    Replace  `<!-- Update this condition -->` with `form.userid.value == 'admin' && form.pwd.value == 'admin'`. 
    
    Run the page and see the output.
    
    ### Correct Username and password

    ## Input Validation
    
    Ensuring the data that is entered by the user is called Input Validation.
    
    Create a new file called `inputValidation.html`. Replace the contents with: 
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Input Validation</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <p>Please input a number between 1 and 10:</p>
    <form>
        <input id="inputNumber" type="text">
        <button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Submit</button>
        <p id="result"></p>
    </form>
    <script>
        function myFunction() {
            var x, text;
            //Get the value of input field with id="numb"
            x = document.getElementById("inputNumber").value;
            // If x is Not a Number or less than one or greater than 10
            if (<!-- Update this condition -->) {
                text = "Input not valid";
            } else {
                text = "Input OK";
            }
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = text;
        }
    </script>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    The requirements for this script is that the code will check the number entered. If the number not one of the following - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, the output will be ‚ÄúInput not valid‚Äù. If the number entered is one of those 10 options, it will output ‚ÄúInput OK‚Äù. **What logic gate/truth table/logic operator is required?**
    
    You could use an OR operator for this task. 
    
    If the number is less than 1 OR the number is greater than 10, OR not a number at all, then output ‚ÄúInput not valid‚Äù, otherwise output ‚ÄúInput OK‚Äù.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ The operator for `OR` in Javascript is `||`
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ There‚Äôs always a number of approaches to code problems such as this. You could write code to individually check if the number entered is 1, then if it‚Äôs 2 etc. Not the most efficient, but it still would satisfy the requirements.
    
    </aside>
    
    Replace `<!-- Update this condition -->` with `isNaN(x) || x < 1 || x > 10`. This If statement has 3 different comparisons to check, with two OR operators between them. This is perfectly valid in most programming languages.

- Variables and Data Types - Web Development
    
    
    # Specific Implementation
    
    Unlike some other languages, Javascript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. This is similar to Python, GDScript and other languages.
    
    Variables must be identified with unique names and must begin with a letter.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Dynamic typed means that variables can change their data types during code execution.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Loosely typed means that the programmer doesn‚Äôt need to specify the data type of a variable.
    
    </aside>
    
    ## Declaring variables
    
    When declaring variables, you can use the `let` or `var` keywords. `let` is a more recent addition to the language, however if your code needs to run on older browsers, use `var`.
    
    As the language is dynamic, there is no need to include the data type in the variable declaration. For example
    
    ![[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_9.57.02_pm.png)
    
    [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)
    
    ## Javascript Data Types
    
    In Javascript, there are a number of the standard primitive types. The syntax for each of these are:
    
    | Data type | Description | Possible Values |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Null | No value associated with the variable |  |
    | IntegerNumber | Numbers between  | -(2^53 ‚àí 1) and 2^53 ‚àí 1. Can also be NaN - Not a Number. |
    | Boolean | Two possible values. | true or false.  |
    | String | Text data. Stored internally as an Array (more on that later). | "Lake Tuggeranong College"
    "32" |
    
    ## Constants
    
    When declaring constants in Javascript, use the const keyword *before* the variable declaration. When declaring a constant, a value must be set.

    # Practical Exercises
    
    Open the Software Development Fundamentals - Web Development project in Webstorm. Right click on the project folder and choose New HTML file.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 10.21.15 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_10.21.15_pm.png)
    
    Give the name of the file as ‚Äúvariables‚Äù.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 10.21.24 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_10.21.24_pm.png)
    
    Replace the contents of the file with the following:
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <body>
    
    <h1>Variables and Data Types - Web Development</h1>
    <p>Variable Output</p>
    
    <p id="simpleOutput"></p>
    
    <script>
        document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
    </script>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 10.21.34 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_10.21.34_pm.png)
    
    You can ‚Äúrun‚Äù the code by clicking on one of the buttons to open in a browser, or open it within Webstorms by clicking on the icon that appears as shown.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 10.25.38 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_10.25.38_pm.png)
    
    The code is a relatively simple HTML file, which has a heading and some text, but importantly for our purposes is the section highlighted here.
    
    This code is rendered by the browser, by creating an empty paragraph tag (<p>) and giving it an identifier of ‚ÄúsimpleOutput‚Äù. In the following <script> </script> code, the code searches for the element with the id of ‚ÄúsimpleOutput‚Äù and replaces its contents with the answer to the equation of 5+6.
    
    This is important, because you can code the <script> </script> to display any information you wish by changing the data that is displayed, or by performing some calculation prior to output.
    
    ```html
    <p id="simpleOutput"></p>
    
    <script>
    document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML= 5 + 6;
    </script>
    ```
    
    ## Calculate the Area of a Circle
    
    The equation for calculating the area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$. To calculate this in Javascript, you could update the Javascript code in the <script>..</script> block like so.\
    
    ```html
    <script>
        const pi = 3.14159;
        radiusOfCircle = 5;
        areaOfCircle = pi * radiusOfCircle * radiusOfCircle;
        document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML = areaOfCircle;
    </script>
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-01-25 at 10.34.58 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-01-25_at_10.34.58_pm.png)
    
    ## Multiple Outputs
    
    If you wish to have multiple outputs in your HTML file, you can add a new <p> tag with a different id.
    
    ```html
    <p>Variable Output</p>
    <p id="simpleOutput"></p>
    
    <p>Area of a Circle</p>
    <p id="areaOfACircle"></p>
    
    <script>
        document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML= 5 + 6;
    
        const pi = 3.14159;
        radiusOfCircle = 5;
        areaOfCircle = pi * radiusOfCircle * radiusOfCircle;
        document.getElementById("areaOfACircle").innerHTML = areaOfCircle;

    # Specific Implementation
    
    Javascript is similar to C and C++ in terms of the syntax and structure, however Javascript typically runs in the browser as client-side (or front-end) scripting. Javascript can also be run on servers.
    
    Consider the following code:
    
    ## Brackets
    
    Notice the use of brackets - () and {} - these are very important in the Javascript language (as they are in C and C++). 
    
    <aside>
    üí° Each open bracket, whichever type, must have a corresponding close bracket.
    
    </aside>
    
    The standard brackets - or parentheses - indicate **conditions** and **parameters** and **arguments**. 
    
    The Curly Brackets - { and } - indicate the start and the end of a code block. This code block can be a **function** (as can be seen in the code sample - `ShowMessage()`)
    
    ```jsx
    function ShowMessage() {
    
        for(var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++){
            alert(arguments[i]);
        }
    }
    
    ShowMessage("Steve", "Jobs");
    ```
    
    ## Semicolon
    
    The details of these topics will be discussed later in the course - just be aware of the different brackets and their uses at this stage.
    
    You may also notice that *almost* each line of code shown ends with a semi-colon. In C-based languages (Java, javascript, Arduino etc), the semi-colon identifies the end of a statement.
    
    ## Whitespace
    
    In programming, whitespace refers to the use of indentation (tabs), space characters new newline characters.
    
    In Javascript, the browser generally ignores whitespace, meaning you can have as many blank lines in your code as you wish - the code will still compile.
    
    Indentation is also not critical, however it makes it easier to read code blocks if indented correcty.

    # Specific Implementation
    
    ## IF..THEN..
    
    Javascript uses the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô C syntax for `if .. then` blocks. 
    
    ```jsx
    if (condition) {
    	...
    }
    ```
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Important to note - the comparison inside the brackets, which determines in the IF statement is true or not is called the **condition.**
    
    </aside>
    
    ### IF..THEN.. Example
    
    In this example the variable `username` is checked to see the contents are the string `admin`. If that is correct, then the block of code within the `{}` is executed, in this case, opening the `user.html`.
    
    In this example, if the `username` is not `admin`, then nothing occurs and the block is skipped.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Note the `==`. In Javascript, this is checking **equality**. A single `=` is an assignment statement.
    
    </aside>
    
    ```jsx
    if (username == 'admin') {
        window.open('user.html')
    }
    ```
    
    ## IF..THEN.. ELSE..
    
    The standard IF..THEN structure can be extended with an ELSE to allow a code block to run if the condition is false.
    
    ```jsx
    if (condition) {
    	...
    } else {
    	...
    }
    ```
    
    ### IF..THEN..ELSE.. Example
    
    An extension of the previous example, this shows that if the condition is false (in this case is `username` is **not** admin), then the else code block is executed, opening `loginError.html`.
    
    ```jsx
    if (username == 'admin') {
        window.open('user.html')
    } else {
    		window.open('loginError.html')
    }
    ```
    
    ## Switch ... Case
    
    Switch cases are a different type of control structure to replace multiple, nested if..then statements. 
    
    Based on a given variable, Javascript code can have multiple cases or a catch-all state - default. They can be used to simplify code, but still provide multiple cases for a variables.
    
    ### Syntax
    
    ```jsx
    switch(expression) {
      case x:
        // code block
        break;
      case y:
        // code block
        break;
      default:
        // code block
    }
    ```
    
    ### Example
    
    ```jsx
    var text;
    var fruits = document.getElementById("myInput").value;
    
    switch(fruits) {
      case "Banana":
        text = "Banana is good!";
        break;
      case "Orange":
        text = "I am not a fan of orange.";
        break;
      case "Apple":
        text = "How you like them apples?";
        break;
      default:
        text = "I have never heard of that fruit...";
    }
    ```
    
    ## **Comparison Operators**
    
    The standard *comparison* operators in Javascript are shown here and can be used in `if` conditions.
    
    | Operator | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | ! | Not |
    | x == y | x is equal to y |
    | x != y | x is not equal to y |
    | x < y | x is less than y |
    | x > y | x is greater than y |
    | x <= y | x is less than or equal to y |
    | x >= y | x is greater than or equal to y |
    
    ## Logical Operators
    
    | Operator | Description | Example |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | && | AND  | form.userid.value == 'admin' && form.pwd.value == 'admin‚Äô |
    | || | OR | form.answer.value == "11111111‚Äù || form.answer.value == "FF‚Äù |
    | ! | NOT | !(form.userid.value == 'admin') |
    
    # Practical Exercises
    
    Create a new file in the Software Development Fundamentals Project called `decisions.html`.
    
    Replace the contents with the code shown.
    
    This page will be used to ask 2 maths based questions. The code will run when the user presses the button, and will check the answers given in the Javascript if statements.
    
    If each answer is correct, the page will show ‚ÄúCorrect!‚Äù next to the answer.
    
    If the answer is incorrect, the page will show ‚ÄúIncorrect!‚Äù instead.
    
    Check the page loads correctly before continuing.

    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    In the checkMaths() function, add the following If statement.
    
    This will look at the input the user entered in the `answerPower` field and compare it to `1024`. If that‚Äôs what the user entered, it will change the `label` with the ID `powerOutput` to `Correct!`
    
    ```jsx
    if (form.answerPower.value == "1024") {
        document.getElementById("powerOutput").innerHTML = "Correct!";
    }

    # Review
    
    1. What is the difference between == and === in javascript?
    2. Include another Maths or logic-based question. Check the answer given and output appropriately.
    3. Write a question where there are two answers needed. For instance, what is 100 in binary and hexadecimal? The output is only `Correct!` if both inputs are correct. [Use this site](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html) to confirm the correct answers.
    4. Write the code necessary to ask users for their favourite movie/car/shoes etc (your choice). Write a switch statement to check for at least 3 different possible answers, as well as a `default` case.

    # Specific Implementation
    
    The Javascript language has the three loop structures identified on the General Learning Resource - `while`, `do..while` and `for`. As Arduino is a C-based language, the syntax for these are the same as with C, C++ etc.
    
    Here you can see the syntax and an example of each.
    
    ## While Loop
    
    ```jsx
    while (condition) {
      // statement(s)
    }
    ```
    
    ### Example
    
    ```jsx
    var = 0;
    while (var < 200) {
      // do something repetitive 200 times
      var++;
    }
    ```
    
    ## Do... While Loop
    
    ```jsx
    do {
      // statement block
    } while (condition);
    ```
    
    ### Example
    
    ```jsx
    int x = 0;
    do {
      delay(50);          // slight delay
      x = x + 1;          // add 1 to x.
    } while (x < 100);
    ```
    
    ## For Loop
    
    ```jsx
    for (initialization; condition; increment) {
      // statement(s);
    }
    ```
    
    ### Example
    
    ```jsx
    for (let i = 0; i <= 100; i++)
      {
        document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML = document.getElementById("simpleOutput").innerHTML+"<br>"+i;
    //prints out 0 to 100 in the browserew
      }
    ```
    
    <aside>
    ‚ÄºÔ∏è Remember the *condition* has to equate to either `true` or `false`.

    Configure the loop to run the required number of times.

    üíÅ When writing loops, you will need to check to make sure it‚Äôs running the correct number of times. So check the specifications. In this case the problem is to output the numbers between 0 and 100 inclusive. Will this loop do **exactly** that?

    Inside the loop, add the code which will build the string of numbers, with <br> tags in between.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ When the loop first runs, `numberOutput` is an empty string - ‚Äú‚Äù. The first iteration adds the loopCounter value, which is 0, and adds to the end of `numberOutput`, adding a `<br>` in between. This means that `numberOutput` is `‚Äú<br>0‚Äù` after the first iteration. 
    In the second iteration `numberOutput` becomes `‚Äú<br>0<br>1‚Äù`
    The loop progresses, adding `<br>` and the `loopCounter` value to the end of the string each time.
    
    </aside>

    ## Do...while loop
    
    For this example, you are going to write a secret number guesser. 
    
    The logic for this code is shown here.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ The code will generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive), and the user will need to guess it.

    Create new file called doWhileLoop.html and replace the contents with this code.
    
    ```jsx
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

        <script>

    ```
    
    Initialise the variables needed.
    
    MIN and MAX in this example are **constants**. This means that the code cannot change the values once they‚Äôve been initialised.
    
    ```jsx
    const MIN = 1;
    const MAX = 10;
    let guesses = 0; // for storing the number of guesses
    let hint = ''; // for storing hint
    let number = 0;
    ```

    Generate the secret number. This code can look quite complex, but breaking it down can make it easier to understand. 
    
    `Math.random()` generates a random decimal point value between 0 and 1. E.g. 0.242
    
    That decimal point value is then multiplied by `(MAX - MIN + 1)`, which will be 10-1+1, equalling 10. 
    
    Finally the `MIN` value is added onto that.
    
    Then, the value calculated is run through `Math.floor()` which rounds down the value to a whole number.
    
    In short, in this case it generates a random number between 1 and 10.
    
    ```jsx
    let secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * (MAX - MIN + 1)) + MIN;
    ```

    Add the `do.. while()` loop structure.
    
    For the moment, don‚Äôt put the condition in - this will be added later.
    
    ```jsx
    do {
                    
    } while ()
    ```

    Prompt the user for a guess.
    
    This is another complex line of code, with multiple functions.
    
    `parseInt()` has been seen before, and this converts the string entered into an integer value.
    
    `prompt()` similarly has been seen before, and asks the user to enter some form of data in a browser popup.
    
    `${MIN}` is replaced in the string when it‚Äôs run with the value of the variable. In this case 0. `${MAX}` is the same, but with 10.
    
    `+ hint` adds the hint string to the end of the prompt. The first time this code is run, the hint is blank.
    
    ```jsx
    let number = parseInt(prompt(`Please enter a number between ${MIN} and ${MAX}` + hint));
    ```
    
    Increase the number of guesses.
    
    This is used as part of the output string when the correct value is guessed. It is a counter.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Remember the ++ means increasing the variable by 1.
    
    </aside>
    
    ```jsx
    guesses++;
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 10.48.11 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_10.48.11_pm.png)
    
    Check if the number guessed is greater than the secret number. If so, then update the hint to be ‚Äú`, and less than ‚Äú` plus the number chosen.
    
    ```jsx
    if (number > secretNumber) {
        hint = ", and less than " + number;
    }
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 10.55.22 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_10.55.22_pm.png)
    
    Following the flowchart, if the number is **not** greater than the secret number, the code should then check if the number is **less** than the secret number. You can use a `else if` statement for this.
    
    ```jsx
    if (number > secretNumber) {
        hint = ", and less than " + number;
    } else if (number < secretNumber) {
        hint = ", and greater than " + number;
    }
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 10.52.35 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_10.52.35_pm.png)
    
    Finally, if both if statements equate to false, as in the number guessed is neither greater than nor less than the secret number, the final check is whether the number guessed equals the secret number.
    
    ```jsx
    if (number > secretNumber) {
        hint = ", and less than " + number;
    } else if (number < secretNumber) {
        hint = ", and greater than " + number;
    } else if (number == secretNumber) {
        alert("Well done! You got the number is " + guesses + " guess/es!");
    		break;
    }
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 11.00.00 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_11.00.00_pm.png)
    
    The last section left is the condition. This loop needs to run while the number guessed is not equal to the secret number. 
    
    ```jsx
    number != secretNumber
    ```
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-19 at 10.57.22 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-19_at_10.57.22_pm.png)

    You‚Äôve already seen functions in javascript through this course.
    
    The code sample shown here demonstrates a function called `loopCode()`.
    
    ```jsx
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <script>
    			function loopCode() {

    ## Code Implementation
    
    Create a new HTML called `functions.html`. Replace the contents with this code.
    
    The code has a form, with two input boxes named `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. 
    
    There are four buttons, which will eventually call one of the four functions that will be written - `addNumbers()`, `subtractNumbers()`, `multiplyNumbers()` or `divideNumbers()`.
    
    ```jsx

        <label><input id="secondNumber" type="number"></label>
        <p></p>
        <button onclick="addNumbers(form.firstNumber.value, form.secondNumber.value)" type="button">Add Numbers</button>

    Create the `addNumbers` function. In the `<script>` tags, create a new function called `addNumbers`, which accepts two parameters - `number1` and `number2`.
    
    ```jsx
    function addNumbers(number1, number2) {

    The function needs to add `number1` and `number2` together and update the tag with the id `result` in the HTML. This can be done in one line of code.
    
    ```jsx
    document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) + parseInt(number2);
    ```

    Test the code at this stage - load the page in the browser. Enter two values in the form and press the Add Numbers button.

    Include the remaining functions, which at this stage are extremely similar to the `addNumbers` function. 
    
    ```jsx
    <script>
        function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) + parseInt(number2);
        }
        function subtractNumbers(number1, number2) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) - parseInt(number2);
        }
        function multiplyNumbers(number1, number2) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) * parseInt(number2);
        }
        function divideNumbers(number1, number2) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) / parseInt(number2);
        }
    </script>
    ```

    Test the page again and ensure that the code works correctly.
    
    ## Divide by Zero
    
    The code works, in most situations. The main potential issue is if the user attempts to divide by zero.
    
    It would be best to update the `divideNumbers()` function to catch that error before any calculation is performed, and present the user with a more useful error.
    
    The flowchart for that function would need to be updated to:
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
    subgraph Divide Numbers
    		terminalStartDivide(["Divide Numbers(number1, number2)"])
    		updatePageDivide["Update 'result' element with number1 / number2"]
    		displayError["Divide by Zero error"]
    		condition{number2 == 0?}
    		terminalEndDivide([End])
    		terminalStartDivide-->condition
    		condition-->|No|updatePageDivide
    		condition-->|Yes|displayError
    		displayError-->terminalEndDivide
    		updatePageDivide-->terminalEndDivide
    	end
    ```

    Add an if statement to check if number2 is a zero.
    
    ```jsx
    function divideNumbers(number1, number2) {
        if (number2 == 0) {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "Divide by Zero Error";
    
        }else {
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = parseInt(number1) / parseInt(number2);

    1. Update the calculator code to use only one function, rather than the original 4. The function would need to take 3 parameters - number1, number2 and operation. The operation would be either ‚Äúadd‚Äù, ‚Äúsubtract‚Äù, ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù or ‚Äúdivide‚Äù. The function would need to check (using an if) what the operation is, and perform the appropriate calculation.
    2. What is the difference between arguments and parameters?
    3. How many parameters can a function have?
    4. Can a function have no parameters yet still return a value?
    5. How many values can a function return at one time?

    # Specific Implementation
    
    In Javascript, the conventions for naming items are:
    
    | Variables | lowerCamelCase |
    | --- | --- |
    | Constants | ALL_CAPITALS |
    | Functions | lowerCamelCase |
    
    It is also standard convention to include comment blocks at the top of the code to explain the code, but also to include function header comments to explain the purpose of each function.
    
    ## Example
    
    ```jsx
    /**
     * Returns x raised to the n-th power.
     *
     * @param {number} x The number to raise.
     * @param {number} n The power, must be a natural number.
     * @return {number} x raised to the n-th power.
     */
    function pow(x, n) {
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    # Practical Exercises
    
    1. Update all existing code to match naming conventions & function header comments.

- Data Structures - Web Dev
    
    
    # Specific Implementation
    
    ## Arrays
    
    ### Declaring Arrays
    
    Arrays are declared in Javascript similar to other modern languages, indicated by the square brackets - `[]`.
    
    This example shows an array called `cars` being declared with three elements.
    
    ```jsx
    let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    ```
    
    Arrays can also be declared ‚Äúempty‚Äù and then adding elements later in code.
    
    ```jsx
    let cars = [];
    cars[0]= "Saab";
    cars[1]= "Volvo";
    cars[2]= "BMW";
    ```
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Javascript handles arrays differently from other languages. They are **resizable**. This means that the code can add or remove elements, as can be seen in the example above.
    
    </aside>
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Javascript arrays can contain a mix of data types. For instance some elements can be integers, others can be strings.
    
    </aside>
    
    ### Accessing Array Elements
    
    Accessing array elements is again similar to other languages - using the index of the element you wish to access.
    
    ```jsx
    let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
    alert (cars[0]); // This will create a popup with the text - Saab.
    cars[2] = "Kia"; // This will override BWM with Kia.
    ```
    
    ## Key Value Pair
    
    Javascript does not natively support Key Value Pairs. However, Javascript can emulate the functionality of Key Value Pair through the use of **Objects**. Objects are beyond the scope of this course, however this will show how to implement this in Javascript.
    
    This object, called pizza, has three keys - `topping`, `sauce` and `size` - and three associated values - `cheese`, `marinara` and `small`.
    
    ```jsx
    const pizza = {
       topping: "cheese",
       sauce: "marinara",
       size: "small"
    };
    ```
    
    > The keys are to the left of the colon¬†**`:`**¬†and the values are to the right of it. Each key-value pair is a¬†`property`. There are three properties in this example:
    > 
    > - The key¬†**topping**¬†has a value¬†**‚Äúcheese‚Äù**.
    > - The key¬†**sauce**¬†has a value¬†**‚Äúmarinara‚Äù**.
    > - The key¬†**size**¬†has a value¬†**‚Äúsmall‚Äù**.
    > 
    > Each property is separated by a comma. All of the properties are wrapped in curly braces.
    > 
    > This is the basic object syntax. But there are a few rules to keep in mind when creating JavaScript objects.
    > 
    > [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-object-keys-tutorial-how-to-use-a-js-key-value-pair/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-object-keys-tutorial-how-to-use-a-js-key-value-pair/)
    > 
    
    ### Accessing Keys and Values
    
    Particular values are access through identifying the keys within square brackets.
    
    Similar to arrays, the code can read and write to and from the item in a similar manner.
    
    ```jsx
    const pizza = {
      topping: "cheese",
      sauce: "marinara",
      size: "small"
    };
    alert(pizza['topping']); // Dialog box appears showing cheese
    pizza['topping'] = "cheese and olives";
    alert(pizza['topping']); // Dialog box appears showing cheese and olives
    
    ```
    
    # Practical Exercises
    
    In this exercise you‚Äôll create an array of 100 random numbers and then calculate the average of them, and display it to the user.
    
    In the Software Development Fundamentals Course, create a new HTML called dataStructures.html and replace the contents with this starter code.
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <script>
            function dataCode() {
    
            }
        </script>
        <title>Data Structures Code</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    <h1>Data Structures - Web Development</h1>
    
    <p id="outputPosition"></p>
    
    <form name="dataForm">
        <button onclick="dataCode()" type="button">Run Data Structures Code</button>
    </form>
    
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    ### Generating 100 Random Numbers
    
    In dataCode(), declare an empty array called `randomValues` which will be used to store the 100 random numbers.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.43.44 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.43.44_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        let randomValues = [];
        ```
        
    
    Write the for loop to iterate 100 times.
    
    In this loop, `loopCounter` is the Loop Control Variable, and it is used in this case to limit the amount of times the loop iterates to 100. Each time the loop iterates, `loopCounter` is increased by 1 (`loopCounter++`). loopCounter will be used to access individual the index of the `randomValues` array.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.45.46 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.45.46_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        for (let loopCounter = 0; loopCounter<100; loopCounter++) {
                        
        }
        ```
        
    
    Generate a random number out of 1000. To do this, Javascript uses the `Math.random()` function which generates a float (decimal value) between 0.0 and 1.0 (but will never be 1.0). To generate a value from 0 to 1000, the result of `Math.random()` is multiplied by 1000.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.49.56 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.49.56_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        let randomNumber = Math.random() * 1000;
        ```
        
    
    Store the `randomNumber` into the `randomValues` array using the `loopCounter` as the index.
    
    <aside>
    üíÅ Technically, the variable randomNumber is not needed in the code. The code could be more efficient by combining the two lines into one : `randomValues[loopCounter] =`***`Math***.random() * 1000;` However this was done just to highlight the different stages.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.52.34 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.52.34_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        randomValues[loopCounter] = randomNumber;
        ```
        
    
    Test the code at this stage, before continuing to ensure that the code is generating the random numbers correctly. 
    
    After the for loop, display the whole array to the user through an `alert()` command.
    
    The numbers generated will be different each time, however it indicates that it is working correctly.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.54.23 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.54.23_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        alert(randomValues)
        ```
        
    
    After testing it the code, the alert command can be commented out by putting two slashes in front of the line of code.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 9.57.06 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_9.57.06_pm.png)
    
    ### Calculating the average
    
    To calculate the average of a set of numbers, you follow this equation.
    
    $$
    average = \frac{total sum}{number of items in set}
    $$
    
    To implement this in code, first you need to declare a variable to keep track of the running total of the values.
    
    Call this variable `total`, and declare it after the loop generating the values.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 10.01.12 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_10.01.12_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        let total = 0;
        ```
        
    
    Create another for loop to iterate 100 times over the array.
    
    The for loop will be the same as the previous one, so you can copy the loop and remove the code in between the brackets as shown.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 10.02.39 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_10.02.39_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        for (let loopCounter = 0; loopCounter<100; loopCounter++) {
                        
        }
        ```
        
    
    Adding all the values together is done by adding `total` to the value stored in the particular index of the array and storing the result back into the `total` variable.
    
    At the end of this loop, `total` will contain a value which is all the random numbers added together.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 10.04.27 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_10.04.27_pm.png)
    
    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        total = total + randomValues[loopCounter];
        ```
        
    
    Finally, to calculate the average, divide the `total` by the number of values, which is 100.
    
    Additionally, output the average variable to the user through an `alert()` command.
    
    ![Screen Shot 2022-02-27 at 10.09.15 pm.png](Javascript%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20d4c546eb40974969b2694c48145e53f9/Screen_Shot_2022-02-27_at_10.09.15_pm.png)

    - Code
        
        ```jsx
        let average = total / 100;
        alert(average);
        ```

    1. **Practical**. Update the Array code calculating the Average, to output the answer to only 2 decimal places.
    2. **Practical.** Create a new file, with the same starter code above, although this time, generate a Key Value Pair called `userDetails` to store the following keys. The values for each key can be collected from the user through prompt() commands. E.g. prompt the user to enter their username and store it in `userDetails[‚Äùusername‚Äù]` etc.
        1. Username
        2. Password
        3. Full Name
        4. Email Address.
        - Answer

                    password: "dummy password",
                    fullName: "dummy fullname",

                userDetails["password"] = prompt("What is your password?");
                userDetails["fullName"] = prompt("What is your Name?");
                userDetails["email"] = prompt("What is your email address?");
            
                var details = userDetails["userName"] + " " + userDetails["password"] + " " + userDetails["fullName"] + " " + userDetails["email"];
                alert(details);
            }
            ```
