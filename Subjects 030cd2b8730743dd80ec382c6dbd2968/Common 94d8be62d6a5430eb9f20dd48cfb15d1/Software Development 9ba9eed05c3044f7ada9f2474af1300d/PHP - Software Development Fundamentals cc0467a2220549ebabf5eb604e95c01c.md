    # Website Development Overview
    
    Front-end website development refers to the client-side of web development, which deals with the design and user experience of a website. This includes technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are used to build the layout, look and feel, and interactivity of a website.
    
    Back-end website development, on the other hand, deals with the server-side of web development, which is responsible for the functionality of a website. This includes technologies such as PHP, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript, as well as databases like MySQL and MongoDB. Back-end developers are responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs on the server and powers the functionality of a website, such as data storage, processing, and retrieval.
    
    In this course, the focus will be on the back-end functionality, with **PHP** being the main language for this. The course will also show how to interface with a database using **SQL**. Whilst building the site, you will also be learning some front-end technologies as well - HTML, CSS and Javascript.

    The code that will be written for this course will be executed in a number of different places - front end code (HTML, CSS and Javascript) are rendered and executed in the browser on the client device. The back-end code is executed on the web server, and this acts as an Intermediary between the client device and the database.

    # PHP Implementation
    
    PHP is a **server side** scripting language. This means that PHP code runs on the server (not the client/browser) and delivers the necessary code to the client to display. 
    
    For example, the server loads user information from the database and checks the username and password. If the password is correct, the browser is to display a message ‚Äúlogin successful‚Äù. 
    
    PHP co-exists with HTML and other Web Technologies. Unlike standard HTML, PHP requires a server to be running to process the PHP code.
    
    PHP was created in 1994, so in terms of Programming Languages it is quite old, but it is very powerful and widespread.
    
    PHP is used by itself but is also the main language in many other frameworks available, such as Wordpress and Laravel.

- Variables and Data Types - PHP
    
    
    # PHP Implementation
    
    In PHP, all user defined variables **********must********** start with `$`. 
    
    For example:
    
    `$username = **"Obiwan Kenobi"**;`
    
    In this case `username` is the variable name.
    
    > Rules for PHP variables:
    A variable starts with the¬†`$`¬†sign, followed by the name of the variable
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (`$age`¬†and¬†`$AGE`¬†are two different variables)
    [https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_variables.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_variables.asp)
    > 
    
    ## Declaring Variables
    
    PHP is a Loosely Typed Language (alternatively called Weakly Typed) meaning the rules for what data can be stored in variables is lax. For example, you do not need to declare the data type of variables when you first use them, unlike other some other languages (most notably C-based languages (Arduino, Java etc). 
    
    ```php
    $radius = 5;
    $area = pi() * $radius * $radius;
    echo "The area is ", $area;
    ```
    
    More complex example:
    
    ```php
    $numberInput = $_GET["age"];
    ```
    
    ## Using Variables
    
    After the variable has been declared and data stored within it, the data can be used at a later stage of the code. When the code executes, the value stored within the variable name is used instead:
    
    This example will calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5.
    
    The output will be :
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-11-21 at 2.52.24 pm.png](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Screenshot_2022-11-21_at_2.52.24_pm.png)
    
    ```php
    $radius = 5;
    $area = pi() * $radius * $radius;
    echo "The area is ", $area;
    
    ```
    
    ```php
    $numberInput = $_GET["age"];
    echo "The square of ".$numberInput." is ".squareNumber($numberInput)."<br>";
    echo "The square root of ".$numberInput." is ".squareRootNumber($numberInput)."<br>";
    echo "<br>";
    ```
    
    ## PHP Data Types
    
    PHP Supports these data types.
    
    | Data type | Description | Possible Values |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Integer | Whole number value. | Range between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647 |
    | Boolean | Value either true or false (1 or 0). | true or false.  |
    | Float | Numbers with decimal point values | 5.3
    0.1 |
    | String | Complex (non-primitive) data type. Comprised of a series of characters in an array. Use double quotes. An an array, Strings allow for more complex functionality, such as converting to integers, searching for substrings, converting to upper case etc. | "Lake Tuggeranong College"
    "32" |
    
    ## Constants
    
    Constants are variables where the channel cannot be changed once it‚Äôs been defined.
    
    ```php
    define("school", "Lake Tuggeranong College");
    ```

    ```
    
    At this stage, the page simple shows the form but doesn‚Äôt do anything with the data when the user presses submit. That‚Äôs where PHP is introduced.
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-11-22 at 9.50.51 am.png](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Screenshot_2022-11-22_at_9.50.51_am.png)
    
    After the form add PHP code to detect if the form has been submitted. This is done through the `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"` check. 
    
    `POST` is a standard webserver protocol, and is linked with the `<form action="contact.php" method="post">` code created earlier. When the user presses the submit button on the form, the form is `post`ed back to the server. The PHP code added detects that `post` and can respond accordingly.
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-11-22 at 9.52.34 am.png](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Screenshot_2022-11-22_at_9.52.34_am.png)
    
    ```php
    <?php
    if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    
    }
    ?>
    ```
    
    If the PHP code detects the post (meaning the user presses the submit button), the code will then access and store the data the user entered into the form field.
    
    `$_POST['inputEmail'];` refers to the field with the name `inputEmail` created earlier. Likewise for `inputMessage`.

    ```php
    $emailAddress = $_POST['inputEmail'];
    $messageSubmitted = $_POST['inputMessage'];
    ```
    
    The last step is then to output the values stored in the two variables. This can be done simply by using the `echo` command to output the values onto the webpage itself.

    ```php
    echo $emailAddress;

    PHP can co-exist with HTML in the source file, meaning it can be challenging to read a single file as there could be a number of languages in a single file.

    ‚ÄºÔ∏è PHP code can be included with HTML as many time as needed in a single file.
    
    </aside>
    
    To start a PHP block, you can either use `<?php` or simple `<?` and end the PHP block with `?>`. 
    
    This code collects data from a HTML form (`$_GET['username']`) and then outputs it in the rendered HTML page.
    
    `echo` outputs information to the rendered page.

    PHP `if` blocks are similar to C (and other languages) in their syntax.
    
    An example of a PHP `if` is:
    
    ```php
    <?php
    $subtotal = 24.5;       // Subtotal of the bill
    $discount = 0.1;        // discount is applied if subtotal is over $50
    $total = 0;
    
    if ($subtotal >= 50) {
        $total = $subtotal - ($subtotal * $discount);
    } else {
        $total = $subtotal;
    }
    
    echo "Total = $" . $total;
    
    ?>

    Find the code which tests if the form has been submitted.
    
    ![SCR-20230120-tl7.png](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/SCR-20230120-tl7.png)
    
    The logic of what needs to be done is shown in this flowchart
    
    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
    terminalStart([Previous code])
    terminalEnd([Continue remainder of code])
    ifFormSubmit{Has form been submitted?}
    ifEmailEmpty{Is Email Field empty?}
    ifMessageEmpty{Is Message Field empty?}
    setEmailErrorFlag[formError = true]
    setMessageErrorFlag[formError = true]
    outputEmailError[Please enter a valid email address]
    outputMessageEmpty[Please enter a message]
    ifError{if formError}
    setEmailAddress["emailAddress <- Email field data"]
    setMessage["messageSubmitted <- Message field data"]
    echoEmail[output email address]
    echoMesssage[output message]
    
    terminalStart-->ifFormSubmit-->ifEmailEmpty-->|True|setEmailErrorFlag-->outputEmailError-->ifMessageEmpty
    ifEmailEmpty-->|False|ifMessageEmpty-->|True|setMessageErrorFlag-->outputMessageEmpty-->ifError
    ifMessageEmpty-->|False|ifError-->setEmailAddress-->setMessage-->echoEmail-->echoMesssage-->terminalEnd
    ```
    
    To implement this logic, first set the value of `$formError` to be `false`.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled.png)
    
    ```php
    $formError = false;
    ```
    
    Next implement the code to check each field and whether it is empty.
    
    PHP has a helper function called `empty()` which returns `true` if the variable or object is empty and `false` if there is some data stored. If the user does not enter an email address, `$_POST['inputEmail'])` will be empty and therefore return `true` which will then run the code in the `if` block.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%201.png)
    
    ```php
    if (empty($_POST['inputEmail'])) {
        $formError = true;
        echo "Enter an email address.";
    }
    if (empty($_POST['inputMessage'])) {
        $formError = true;
        echo "Enter a message to submit.";
    }
    ```
    
    The remainder of the existing code which collects and then displays the email address and message entered can remain the same, although be placed in an `if` block to check if the `formError` variable has been set to `true`.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%202.png)
    
    ```php
    if ($formError == false) {
            ...
    }
    ```
    
    Test the changes made. Check the functionality by testing all combinations of data (‚úÖ) and no data (‚ùå).

    # PHP Implementation
    
    In PHP, functions are identified with the `function` keyword. 
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%203.png)
    
    PHP functions can be called from other PHP blocks.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%204.png)
    
    ## PHP Arguments
    
    Functions can accept data through Arguments. Arguments are declared in the function declaration as with many other programming languages. 
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%205.png)
    
    ## PHP Return Data
    
    PHP does not **************require************** the declaration of return data when declaring functions. Arguably it is recommended to do so if known, however not strictly required.
    
    When declaring functions, identify the return data type after the `()` with `: <data type>`.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%206.png)
    
    # Practical Exercises
    
    <aside>
    üèÅ **********Goal**********
    
    In this task, you‚Äôll be creating code functions that will be used multiple times throughout the site. 
    
    </aside>
    
    The site being developed requires a number of forms on various pages, and on those pages will have a number of fields that need to be completed.
    
    ## Template Page
    
    Open your `Software-Development Fundamentals-PHP` project. Open Create a new PHP file called `template.php`. Add the file to Git if required.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%207.png)
    
    $* \normalsize \mathcal {\color{black} \colorbox {orange}  {Save, Commit and Push Changes to Github!}}$ 
    
    ## Footer Code
    
    A simple example of implementing functions at this stage is to create a function to have a standardised footer on all pages across the site.
    
    Open `template.php`.
    
    Create a new function called `footer()`. This function doesn‚Äôt need any parameters as it will simply dynamically generate the HTML code for the footer and return it to where it was called from.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%208.png)
    
    Add the code to generate a string which includes the last date and time that the file was saved.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%209.png)
    
    ```php
    $filename = basename($_SERVER["SCRIPT_FILENAME"]);
    $footer = "This page was last modified: " . date("F d Y H:i:s.", filemtime($filename));
    return $footer;
    ```
    
    Create `index.php` if there is not already one created. Replace the contents of the file with the default code.
    
    ```php
    <!doctype html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
        <title>PHP Template</title>
        <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    
    </body>
    <script src="js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" ></script>
    </html>
    ```
    
    Add the PHP code to load another file into the current file for the server to process.
    
    <aside>
    ‚ÄºÔ∏è Including other files can save you a lot of development time, as you can write the code once and access it many times. Having a central location for this shared code can also make it quicker to update code, as there is only one place to update code, not spread out through other files.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    ```php
    <?php include "template.php"?>
    ```
    
    Execute and output the result from `footer()` near the bottom of the page - just before `</body>`. 
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    ```php
    <?php echo footer() ?>
    ```
    
    Open the page in the browser and you should see the footer output.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    One of the issues with the output is that the time is not correct, specifically, it is in GMT. Edit `template.php` to first set the timezone correctly before generating the time the file was modified. 
    
    Save the file.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    ```php
    date_default_timezone_set('Australia/Canberra');
    ```
    
    Open `index.php` in the browser again and the time should be accurate.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2014.png)
    
    $* \normalsize \mathcal {\color{black} \colorbox {orange}  {Save, Commit and Push Changes to Github!}}$ 
    
    ## Sanitising Data
    
    Open `template.php`.
    
    One of the biggest issues, outside the actual website development, that need to be considered throughout the process, is the security of site itself. Whenever websites accept data through forms, it is possible that malicious users could attempt to cause issues by including code in the form.
    
    This is known as Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
    
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhOcAZJp81s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhOcAZJp81s)
    
    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_nIIcKTxGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_nIIcKTxGk)
    
    As there is many fields for data to be submitted, instead of individually sanitising each field, a function can be written to sanitise the data and when the forms are submitted, the function is called for each field.
    
    Declare a new function called `sanitiseData` which accepts a variable which will be the unsanitised data.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2015.png)
    
    ```php
    function sanitiseData($unsanitisedData)
    {
    
    }
    ```
    
    This function, at this stage, will manipulate `unsanitisedData` in three ways.
    
    First, the string is `trim`ed which removes white space (spaces/tabs) from the beginning of the string.
    
    E.g.           `data` becomes `data`.
    
    Then `stripslashes` is run on the trimmed string which removes any `\` from the string which can be used to indicate a string with quotes within it.
    
    E.g. `stripslashes("Who\'re you?")` would return `Who're you?`
    
    Finally, `htmlspecialchars` is run which convert certain characters (&, ‚Äú,. ‚Äò, < and >) into the HTML code version. This removes the possibility that the string will have HTML code included.
    
    E.g. `echo("This is some <b>bold</b> text.");` will be converted to `This is some &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.` . The browser then renders (displays) this as normal, however it couldn‚Äôt run it as code.
    
    ![Untitled](PHP%20-%20Software%20Development%20Fundamentals%20cc0467a2220549ebabf5eb604e95c01c/Untitled%2016.png)
    
    ```php
    $unsanitisedData = trim($unsanitisedData);
    $unsanitisedData = stripslashes($unsanitisedData);
    $sanitisedData = htmlspecialchars($unsanitisedData);
    return $sanitisedData;
    ```
    
    This function will be used in the future whenever data is uploaded through a HTML form.

    ## Contact Page
    
    Create a new file `contact.php` and copy the contents of index into it.
    
    Add code to create the HTML form below the H1 tag and about the footer() output.
    
    ```php
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <h1 class="text-primary">Please Send us a Message</h1>
        <form action="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]); ?>" method="post">
            <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="contactEmail" class="form-label">Email address</label>
                <input type="email" class="form-control" id="contactEmail" name="contactEmail"
                       placeholder="name@example.com">
            </div>
            <div class="mb-3">
                <label for="contactMessage" class="form-label">Message</label>
                <textarea class="form-control" id="contactMessage" name="contactMessage" rows="3"></textarea>
            </div>
            <button type="submit" name="formSubmit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
        </form>
    </div>
