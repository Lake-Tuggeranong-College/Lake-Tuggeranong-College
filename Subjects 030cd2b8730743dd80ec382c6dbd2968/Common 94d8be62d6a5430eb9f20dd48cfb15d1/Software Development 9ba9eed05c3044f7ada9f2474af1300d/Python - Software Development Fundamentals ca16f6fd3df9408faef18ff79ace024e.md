    ‼️ Before starting this course, you will need to have the following installed:
    - PHPStorm installed. Version 2022.2.1+
    - PHP 8.0+ (possibly installed through XAMPP)

    PHP co-exists with HTML and other Web Technologies. Unlike standard HTML, PHP requires a server to be running to process the PHP code.
    
    PHP was created in 1994, so in terms of Programming Languages it is quite old, but it is very powerful and widespread.
    
    PHP is used by itself but is also the main language in many other frameworks available, such as Wordpress and Laravel.

    # Practical Exercises
    
     Create a new project in PHPStorm. Call the project `Software-Development Fundamentals-PHP.`
    
    This will be the PHP project for the duration of the Software Fundamentals Course.

    Right-click on the project name and choose New→PHP File.

    Enter the filename as `index` and click OK.

    With `index.php` open, move the mouse over the code and you should see a preview toolbar appear. Open the page in the Inbuilt browser - the first button.

    At this stage, you will most likely receive an error “502 Bad Gateway”. A notification should appear asking you to configure the PHP Interpreter. Click that link.
    
    Under `CLI Intepreter` , select the latest version of PHP installed, and select Ok.

    When you open the Preview again, the page should be blank. This means PHP is installed and working.

    ## Test!
    
    Edit `index.php` so that the code is as shown here.
    
    ```php
    <?php
    echo "Hello World";
    ?>
    ```
    
    When the preview is refreshed, you should see the text `Hello World` appear on the web page.
