# User Testing

# Questioning - User Feedback

Identify the people you wish to test and provide feedback on your **project**.  Ideally, they will provide constructive feedback on the project at the stage of development most importantly, where the project could improve.

When choosing people to ask to test your project, consider having a broad range demographics, and don't be afraid of getting tough feedback.

Here are some links to information on testing:

## Questioning

To get feedback on your project, create a google form by clicking on the link below

[http://forms.new/](http://forms.new/)

In the form, you can design a number of questions to get feedback on your **project** from the users reviewing it.

You need to collect information on the user (skill level, if they liked your **project** etc) and gain some suggestions on how to improve it.

The more questions you ask, the more feedback you can gain. You will need to gain some generic information as well as specific questions regarding **your** project.

Below is an example of a generic form - notice how there are no questions specific to the **project** being played. This could make it harder to gain specific information about how to improve your project.

You could ask questions such as:

- "**Did the ship match the style of the project?**", or
- "**Please rate (out of 10) how much you enjoyed trying to find a spot to hide from the enemy?**"
- "**Do you think that the project would be more interactive if you were a third-person minion instead of first person?**"

## User Data

In your feedback form, make sure you ask questions about the user, such as:

- Name
- Background
- Age Bracket, e.g.
    - 0-18
    - 19-25
    - etc.
- Technical Skills
    - Out of 5
- etc.

This information will provide you some background to their answers.

Additionally it will let you focus in on the feedback for the users in your target audience.
