## Assessment Finalisation

# Read the Assessment Sheet & Rubric

Re-read the assessment sheet and Rubric available to you through Google Classroom.

<aside>
‚ÄºÔ∏è The Rubric is the most important document. This indicates what (and only what) you can get marks for.

</aside>

Make sure you‚Äôve got something to submit for each of the topics listed in the rubric.

# Complete submission

In whatever format the assessment has to be in (Document, Presentation, Code, Video etc), work on covering all the topics required. 

Read the information on how to earn the different Grade levels. 

As a General Rule they are:

| Grade | Required Standard |
| --- | --- |
| E | The submission barely covers the base requirements of the topic. |
| D | The submission doesn‚Äôt cover all of the base requirements of the topic. |
| C | The submission covers the base requirements of the topic. For example, submits the in-class tasks. |
| B | The submission includes the base requirements and also includes an analysis of the topic. This analysis could include an in-depth explanation of how the topic functions, including correct technical terminology. |
| A | All of the above, and a critical analysis - evaluating the approach taken, offering other potential solutions, using research, and weighing the pros and cons of each approach. |

# Proof Read / Sanity Check

Review your submission, check for spelling and grammar mistakes.

<aside>
‚ÄºÔ∏è Grammarly is a very useful (and free) plugin for your browser which offers additional writing support beyond the usual offerings in Word, Google Docs etc. Search for Grammarly in your extension store.

</aside>

# Submit

Attach all the required files to the Assessment on Google Classroom and press Hand In.

The good news is that the courses are set up in such a way that you have the opportunity to be assessed for all of these competencies **if** you complete a Major. There are other methods to obtain competencies - discuss your situation with your teacher.
